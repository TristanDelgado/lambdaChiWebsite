        <h1>Don't Pledge.</h1>
        <h1>Associate.</h1>
        <p class="description">Here at Lambda Chi Alpha we strive on being different. Doing away with 
            pledging in 1972 we called our potential members "Associates." Associates have every right 
            as all other Brothers. From attending chapter to wearing our letters we respect and want 
            participation from our potential new members. Apply to today to "Associate" with the 
            Lambda Chi Alpha Brotherhood.
